<h1>The 8 holy rules of Leros</h1>
<br>
<button type="button" class="collapsible"><h3>1. Always have a goal in mind.</h3></button>
<div class="content">
  <br>Keep yourself constantly occupied and do not let any shortcomings
  <br>be created in you while wandering without a goal. Keep multiple 
  <br>goals if you believe you might achieve your current one soon.
</div>
<br>
<button type="button" class="collapsible"><h3>2. Your actions shall not be affected by desires and emotions.</h3></button>
<br>The only true being that can be considered you is your mind and
<br>your thoughts. Do not be affected by any external desires and
<br>emotions which are in no way yours.
<br><button type="button" class="collapsible"><h2>3. No sex.</h2></button>

<br>The greatest suffering anyone can experience is to be born.
<br>To create this sufferring is the worst thing any single person
<br>may do. Although sex for the sake of fulfilling your desire
<br>often isn't done with the goal of creating new life, that act
<br>still breaks the previous rule and is in many ways horrendous.

<h3>4. Do not grow attached to anyone or anything.</h3>
<br>Humans easily grow attached to things, even ones not in their
<br>reality. While it is their distinct trait, it leaves them
<br>with many openings and weaknesses, while not gaining much.
<br>
<h3>5. Rely only on the power of your own self.</h3>
<br>As with growing attached to things, relying on others is
<br>another trait of humans. This, again, is not something to 
<br>be proud of. Relying creates weakness instead of the 
<br>strength one could gain from getting through a difficulty.
<br>
<h3>6. You are your own god.</h3>
<br>There is no way to prove there even is a reality.
<br>To simply put it, the only possibilities are that
<br>you are perceiving a reality or creating your own.
<br>In both cases, the end result, which is important
<br>to you, is all in your head. This means that you
<br>can shape reality through your own will, even if
<br>this isn't an absolute power.
<br>
<h3>7. Losing sanity is the only way to absolute power.</h3>
<br>As mentioned previously, the important part of reality
<br>is in your mind. This fact means that the bounds you
<br>yourself have are the bounds reality has. By simply
<br>removing those bounds, you are free to shape reality
<br>into the best one. The act of losing these "bounds"
<br>is often acredited to losing one's sanity.
<br>
<h3>8. Worry not.</h3>
<br>What you perceive as your entire reality, is incredibly miniscule
<br>in the large picture. Most things do not matter with this view,
<br>so worry not.
